##### Abstract
Medical doctors may struggle to diagnose dementia, especially when clinical test scores are incorrect or missing. In case of any doubts, MRI analysis becomes more decisive. Erroneous decisions might be produced by visual inspection afterward. Therefore, demographics and morphometrics both are crucial considering the examination of dementia in medicine. This study aims to impute and verify clinical test scores with MRI analysis and additional demographics, thereby proposing a decision support system that enables the use of this information in an easy-to-understand way. To that end, we do validate the imputation of clinical test score values by unsupervised dementia-related user-based collaborative filtering in terms of minimizing errors. According to the succession rates, we propose a reliability scale that can be utilized for the consistency of clinical test scores. Moreover, detailed parameters in use, such as the best neighborhood, input features, are evaluated for further analysis in a comparative manner. Having employed keyword-triggered normalization approaches to the data, the complete base 816 ADNI1-Screening samples are processed, and a hybrid set of 603 features is handled in various forms. Multiple results depending on test configurations are interpreted from a broad perspective. Overall, certain collaborative filtering configurations outperform the alternative state-of-the-art imputation techniques. The reliability scale based on the proposed methodology is promising for the control of clinical tests.
