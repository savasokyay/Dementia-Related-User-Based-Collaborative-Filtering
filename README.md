##### Abstract
Medical doctors may struggle to diagnose dementia, especially when clinical test scores are missing or incorrect. Besides, both morphometrics and demographics are crucial considering the examination of dementia in medicine. This study aims to impute and verify clinical test scores with brain MRI analysis and additional demographics, thereby proposing a decision support system that improves diagnosis and prognosis in an easy-to-understand way. To that end, (i) we do validate the imputation of clinical test score values by unsupervised dementia-related user-based collaborative filtering in terms of minimizing errors. Moreover, detailed parameters in use, such as the best neighborhood, input features, are evaluated for further analysis in a comparative manner. Analyzing the succession rates, (ii) we propose a reliability scale that can be utilized for the consistency of clinical test scores. The complete base 816 ADNI1-Screening samples are processed, and a hybrid set of 603 features is handled. Overall, certain collaborative filtering configurations outperform the alternative state-of-the-art imputation techniques. The imputation system and the reliability scale based on the proposed methodology are promising for the control of clinical tests.
