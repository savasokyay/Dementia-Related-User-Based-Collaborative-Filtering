This processed dataset size is actually 816x605 (double).
However, you can only view the code, but not debug it properly. The raw or preprocessed dataset cannot be shared due to copyright. You can access the raw brain scans at ADNI Access Data (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/) webpage.

If you want to understand how the code works, you can create a random matrix having the name "mtrxData" with the corresponding size.
